# Project: Inversion

This project is not a game. It is **Satisfaction**. I have created this because it pleases me and maybe to you too.

<img src="display.png" alt="game" style="margin-left: 15px;" />

It uses the P5 Javascript Libraries. Unlike other projects, this doesn't need a server. You can directly run the `Index.html` file.

**The Controls are:**

* Eyes.
* Satisfaction Chemical in your brain.
* Enjoy! WOW!
