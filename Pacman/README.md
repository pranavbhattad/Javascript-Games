You can play the game on all canvas-enabled browsers.  **Touch controls** are enabled for mobile browsers.  The game is **resolution-independent** and smoothly scales to
fit the size of any screen.  **Performance** may increase by shrinking the window or zooming in with your browser.

Games
-----

Each of the following games is playable from the main menu.

- **Pac Man**: 1980 original arcade by Namco.
- **Ms. Pac Man**: 1981 Pac Man modification by GCC/Midway.
- **Cookie Man**: a brand new version of Ms. Pac Man with a sophisticated **procedural map generator**.

### Turbo Mode

Each game has an alternate mode called Turbo (a.k.a. speedy mode).  This feature is a popular hardware modification of the game found in many of the original arcades cabinets.  In this mode, Pac Man travels about twice as fast (same speed as the disembodied eyes of the
ghosts) and is not slowed down when eating pellets.
