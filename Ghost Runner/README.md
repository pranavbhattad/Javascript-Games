# Project: Ghost Runner

This game is **A Horror Game**. It is a deadly and creepy game. Play at your own risk. Honestly, I am scared of this game!

It is a creepy project. It uses P5 Javascript Libraries. This project needs a server. It would be best if you had a local server like:

* Python Server
* 200 OK Server
* VS Code Live Server

**The controls are:**

* WASD CONTROLS for moving [up, down, right, left]
* `Space` Button to Jump or Move up.
* You can rest for a handful of seconds on the top of the climber.
* If your head touches the climber's green box, then your game is over.
